# paypalPaymentNodejs

A simple sample of how a paypal payment button can be implemented in a website . 
The dependencies are express , express-handlebars (optional) , express-session (optional) , connect-flash (optional) , dotenv (optional) ,
paypal-rest-sdk & nodemon -D (optional , for developing). In fact , the only two dependencies that you need to install are express and
paypal-rest-sdk . I used the others because i wanted to do the project more complete (with flash meessages for alerts) and obviously had 
to secure my idÂ´s and keys with dotenv.
